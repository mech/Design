## Notes

* Creating a sense of mastery can be tricky. It's not just about exposing common features and hiding advanced stuffs.
* Straightforward is better than clever. I love to be creative and invent new UX paradigms, but remember: if it feels familiar your users will feel safe.
* Make users feel masterful.
* As each element is added, it's important to ask yourself: "How does this add to the story?" "Is this part of the core message?" and be prepared to remove elements when the answer is no.
