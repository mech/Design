# Bohemian Sketch Tips

> Illustration is content. Like the writer who tells the story of how a product fits seamlessly into our lives, illustrators use literary tools to connect complex ideas to the relatable experiences behind them, working to unearth the deeper reasons and intangible benefits that drive us to use a product - [Using Metaphor in Product Illustration](https://medium.com/shopify-ux/effectively-using-metaphor-in-product-illustration-62bdccbe14e4#.a98qkyao6)

Getting the most out of Resizing requires advanced planning. Nothing is automatic, Sketch isn't going to inherently know how you expect the elements within a group or symbol to behave, but the four resizing options give you remarkable degree of flexibility.

To build more advanced layouts, you need to use hidden helper layers, shape groups or masking.
