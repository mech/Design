> Even with a team like GLUE, the design language at Spotify is not dictated as a top-down approach. It's a balance of the team facilitating and leading design guidelines while relying on product designers who are working on new patterns to bubble those back up to them. - Spotify

> Being embedded works really well, because we know what the team is working on, we know what kind of insights they could use and how they would use those insights. We design our studies with that in mind, it's never in a vacuum. We always try to learn things with a purpose.
