# Process

> Here's the simple truth: you can't innovate on products without first innovating the way you build them. We believe we can achieve this by investing in our own internal tools.

---

> At the end of the day your customers don't care whether you're agile, lean or practice design thinking. They care about great products and services that solve meaningful problems for them in effective ways.

---

> Over the last 10 years i've worked on quite a few, large scale design systems. In all of them, there was a distributed technical system that had grown organically. A few CMS's here and there. PHP, .net, etc etc. It's not like you could create a bunch of HTML and it would work everywhere. Far, far from it.
> 
> And then, editorially, many of the departments of these organisations were creating content without any joined up thinking. It was common for them to have their own budgets to create their own mini projects (yes, with their own CMS) and they'd hire a little design firm to do it.
> 
> From a branding perspective, there was normally a small, internal, over-worked branding team who were constantly and consistently putting out fires that the organisational structure creates. Everywhere you look people were degrading the brand.

> Pick small topic! If you pick a huge topic then there is not much room for your creative efforts. On the other hand, if you pick a small topic you have time and energy to make a great creative contribution. A small topic works like a catalyst for your ideas and leaves you enough room to come up with great results.

* Moodboards and Inspiration
* Style-tiles and Element Collages
* Icons in various formats
* Branding Identity Guidelines

## Agile

* Plan for multiple releases from the very beginning.
* Delivers feature by feature is more predictable.
* Delivering release by release, feature by feature, lets us ship value sooner.
* Feature by feature gives better information, better guidance, better results. Better outcomes. All incrementally. All visibly. We can see how much is "done".
* Management gets visible progress at short intervals.
* Build features and foundation in parallel.
* Don't build feature out to its fullest glory.
* Inferior design will slow us down. Skill and care are required to keep our project alive.
* Every change tends to break our current design. To keep the design good, we need to improve it as we go. Keeping the design good as it changes is called refactoring.
* To progress, the design must improve continually. Improving the design by refactoring is the technique for doing this.

> Technology-inspired technology gives us incremental improvements. Art-inspired technology gives us brand new ideas. - Amy Wibow

> It didn't need to be complex.

> Remember, we ultimately don't develop code, we develop products that people use. We should use the best language for the job and let the snobs titter away into irrelevance.

> The painter, when at a distance from the easel, can assess and analyze the whole of the work from this vantage. He scrutinizes and listens, chooses the next stroke to make, then approaches the canvas to do it. Then, he steps back again to see what he's done in relation to the whole. It is a dance of switching contexts, a pitter-patter pacing across the studio floor that produces a tight feedback loop between mark-making and mark-assessing. - The Shape of Design

> Content needs to be structured and structuring alters your content, designing alters content. It's not 'content then design', or 'content or design'. It's 'content and design'. - Mark Boulton

> The digital world isn't constrained by the same limitations as the physical one. Pixels are cheap. Changes can happen in an instant, hypotheses can be quickly tested out, and designs and code can be iterated on again and again.

* Celebrate small wins.
* Build your perspective.
* Constraints are often advantages in disguise. Work with what you have. - Getting Real
