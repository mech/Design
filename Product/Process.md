# Process

* [The Design Team](https://thedesignteam.io/)

## Agile

* Plan for multiple releases from the very beginning.
* Delivers feature by feature is more predictable.
* Delivering release by release, feature by feature, lets us ship value sooner.
* Feature by feature gives better information, better guidance, better results. Better outcomes. All incrementally. All visibly. We can see how much is "done".
* Management gets visible progress at short intervals.
* Build features and foundation in parallel.
* Don't build feature out to its fullest glory.
* Inferior design will slow us down. Skill and care are required to keep our project alive.
* Every change tends to break our current design. To keep the design good, we need to improve it as we go. Keeping the design good as it changes is called refactoring.
* To progress, the design must improve continually. Improving the design by refactoring is the technique for doing this.
